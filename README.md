Reduced [original gist](https://gist.github.com/obelisk68/15ffdf1bfd82953361be0264b5ea4119) LOC from 211 to ~125.  
Now adding features -- some of them are listed below in the TODO list.

For cool font that you see above, [download the .zip from Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/download?family=Press%20Start%202P) and unpack the `PressStart2P-Regular.ttf` to the cloned repo directory where you run the `bundle install && bundle exec ruby main.rb`. By default ruby2d looks for font only in system directory -- this is why ruby2d dependency here was [forked and patched](https://github.com/Nakilon/ruby2d/commit/a80fa4b47e713e22995a7c2698fd055f5464b23b) a bit to support sourcing current directory and `$HOME/Library/Fonts` one.

TODO:

* [ ] projetion of the piece at the bottom
* [x] [SRS canonical rotation](https://tetris.fandom.com/wiki/SRS)
* [ ] shift a piece by bouncing of the walls when rotating

* [ ] autoresize to screen
* [ ] option to restart
* [ ] cheat for testing purposes
* [x] canonical increase of speed
* [x] holding LEFT and RIGHT
