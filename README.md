## Notes

By default ruby2d looks for a font only in one system directory -- this is why ruby2d dependency here was [forked and patched](https://github.com/Nakilon/ruby2d/commit/a80fa4b47e713e22995a7c2698fd055f5464b23b) a bit to support sourcing from the working directory (and `$HOME/Library/Fonts`).

It can't be compiled to binary right now because of using a Mutex class that is not in MRuby.

It's hard to continue fitting it into 200 lines but I want to add more features -- maybe I'll make a "300-LOC" branch.

Cool font is [Press Start 2P from Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Press+Start+2P).
